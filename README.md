Demon Slayer Fan Park:

This is a simple fan website based on the anime Demon Slayer (Kimetsu no Yaiba).
I built this project as part of the WebWiz induction task to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and to apply what I’ve been learning in frontend development.

Live Website:

* Live link: https://tushar-codes-in.github.io/demon-slayer-fan-park/

* Repository: https://github.com/tushar-codes-in/demon-slayer-fan-park

What this website includes:

* Sections for main characters, Hashira, Muzan, and all Upper Moons

* Image gallery and trailer links

* Dark and light mode toggle

* A small quiz: Which Demon Slayer are you?

* Basic scroll animations

* Responsive layout for different screen sizes

Technologies used:

* HTML

* CSS

* JavaScript

* Git and GitHub

* GitHub Pages for deployment

Why I built this:

I wanted to make something beyond a basic static page.
This project helped me understand how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together in a complete website, and how to deploy and manage a project using GitHub.

What I learned:

* Structuring a website properly using HTML

* Styling and layout using CSS

* Adding interactivity using JavaScript

* Using Git commands and pushing code to GitHub

* Deploying a live website using GitHub Pages

Future improvements:

* Add more character details

* Improve animations

* Better mobile responsiveness
